# Authorization Extension: Import/Export Data

You can import new data from or export existing authorization data to a JSON file. This can be useful when moving environments. However, remember that roles and permissions are linked to specific clients, so you'll need to update the correct `clientId`.

You can get to the **Import/Export** section by clicking **Configuration** on the drop-down menu accessible by clicking on your tenant name at the top right of the **Authorization Dashboard**.

Click **Import/Export**.

Use this form to copy and paste or edit the JSON data. Then, click either the **IMPORT** or **EXPORT** button to begin the import/export process.
