# Authorization Extension: API Access

Once configured and set up, your extension should contain users, as well as groups, roles, and permissions. You can automate provisioning and query the authorization context of your users in real-time if you enable API access to your extension.

## Enable API Access

Log in to the Management Dashboard, and open up the [Authorization Extension](${manage_url}/#/extensions).

To get to **API** section, click on your Auth0 tenant name on the top right of the **Authorization Dashboard**. Click **API**.

On the **Settings** page, use the toggle to enable API Access. Click over to the **Explorer** page for API documentation.
